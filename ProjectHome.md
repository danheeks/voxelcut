Based on voxlap by Ken Silverman, this does a solid simulation of a milling machine.
Version 0.2 is unfinished; It is only setup for simulating the NC code from a Bridgeport Series I machine. I hope to adapt it to be able to be configured for any machine, using the scripts from HeeksCNC.

It is GPL license, because voxlap is GPL license.

Voxlap uses DirectDraw, so I guess this is only for Windows.

This project can be built with Visual Studio 2008 Express ( which is free )
